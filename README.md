# Homework

## Contents

- `hw1/` (40 pts): implement and benchmark operations with different arithmetic intensity. **Requires a GPU** (H100 or L40S).
- `hw2/` (60 pts): profile and optimize an autoregressive generation loop. **Requires a GPU** (L40S recommended; speedup targets are calibrated against it).
- `hw3/` *(optional, ungraded)*: build the memory and scheduling core of a mini LLM inference engine. **Runs on CPU — no GPU needed.**

HW1 and HW2 together add up to **100 points**. See each subfolder's `README.md` for the per-part point breakdown and the expected submission format.

## Setup

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y python3-dev
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Use a fresh virtualenv for this repo. Reusing an older environment with extra packages can create version conflicts with the pinned dependencies.

See the `README.md` inside each subfolder for task details, requirements, and expected outputs.

## GPU VM on Nebius (optional)

To provision an L40S GPU VM for HW1/HW2, see [`terraform-manifests/README.md`](terraform-manifests/README.md).
